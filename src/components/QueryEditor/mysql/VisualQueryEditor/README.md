## VisualQueryEditor

### First step

We should implement 4 rows:
- FROM
- SELECT
- WHERE
- GROUP BY

For sure, each row should have a lable.

#### FROM

Select the table to query.  
Tables should be auto detected by querying.

Besize, we should specify the time column here.

#### SELECT

Simply select the column you want to query.
Column names should also be auto detected.

#### WHERE

#### GROUP BY
